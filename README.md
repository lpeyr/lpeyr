## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I am a developer, and the founder of [@Leo-Corporation](https://github.com/Leo-Corporation).
- 🖥 I'm using WPF to create Windows applications. (I used to work with Windows Forms)
- 📚 I learned programming by myself, which allowed me to gain some experience in C#, WPF, and more generally in the .NET framework.
- 💻 C#, XAML, VB.NET, HTML, CSS, JS, TS, Python...
- 🌐 I recently built and deployed my first Next.js application (ex: [Passliss](https://passliss.leocorporation.dev/)).
